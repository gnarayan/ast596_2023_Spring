Homework assignments will be in here.
- Once you've cloned the repo, create a branch of your own, or a fork of the repo
- Create a subdirectory with your name as FirstnameLastname within this directory
- Create a homework solution notebook in your own directory
- The only files that should be changed in the repo must live in your own directory
- I suggest commiting early and often
- When you are done editing your homework solution and you are ready to submit, pull request
