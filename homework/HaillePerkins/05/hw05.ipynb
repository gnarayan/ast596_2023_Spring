    "### The Kepler satellite has discovered many multi-planet systems. You can download artwork for some of them even at the [Exoplanet Travel Bureau](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/exoplanet-travel-bureau/)\n",

    "### But is there a system like our own Solar system with 8 planets (sorry Pluto)? In fact, there may be at least one - [Kepler 90](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/science/eight-planets-star-system.html). This along with most other Kepler planets, were not discovered through radial velocity measurements like our example in class (i.e. that nice parameteric model doesn't apply), but were rather discovered through transits - dips in the light of the star as the planet moves around it.\n",

    "\n",
    "### I've included some code to get the light curve, clean it and remove the NaNs, and some outliers (you can judge the wisdom of strong outlier removal when you are hunting for planets), and bin the light curve a little bit in time.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lightkurve` has a bunch of useful [tutorials](https://docs.lightkurve.org/index.html), in particular [this one](https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/3-science-examples/periodograms-creating-periodograms.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* once you get to a periodogram with `lightkurve`, `find_peaks` in `scipy` can help identify the exoplanet peaks\n",
    "\n",
    "* You might find it easier to remove the signal of each planet as you find it and work with the residual light curve to find the next. This isn't strictly necessary if you do the previous steps well, but can be helpful. The tutorials page has a demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [The Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html) might be of help\n",
